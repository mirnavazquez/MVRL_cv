intro,"As a postdoctoral fellow at the [Baker Lab](https://sites.utexas.edu/baker-lab/),   I am studying the ocean's microbial communities, interested mainly in their metabolisms and phylogenetic diversity. 

My interest in bioinformatics and genomics took me to my first postdoc at the [Genomics and transcriptomics lab at the INECOL](https://www.inecol.mx/personal/index.php/moleculares/139-enrique-ibarra-laclette).  Where I used the pan-genome paradigm to design a method to identify a phytopathogenic fungus that was killing trees at the Mexican-US border.

I did my Ph.D. at the [Ecology Institute at the UNAM](http://www.ecologia.unam.mx/web/) in Mexico City. During this time, I studied the landscape genomics of a rare lineage of Vibrionaceae isolated from [Cuatro Cienegas](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/watch-threatened-pools-mexican-desert-hold-clues-early-life), looking for the genes that could explain the adaptation to this ultra-oligotrophic environment.

I enjoy teaching and sharing knowledge, and I love the R community. I start using R when I became part of the [CDSB](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io) and [Rladies community](https://rladies.org) and then a co-organizer of [RLadies Xalapa](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-xalapa/), a safe place for minorities to learn how to code.
