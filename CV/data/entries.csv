education,PhD in Sciences,"National Autonomous University of Mexico, Ecology Institute. ","Mexico City, MX",2012,2017,**Title**: Patterns of diversification and adaptation of the Vibrionaceae family. The case of Cuatro Cienegas.,**Advisor**: Dr. Valeria Souza Saldivar. ,"**Description**: I examined the evolutionary footprints of local adaptation in the genomes of bacteria isolated from a highly oligotrophic environment in Cuatro Cienegas (CCB), Mexico. I obtained 200 axenic isolates of Vibrionaceae, a group of bacteria with a cosmopolitan distribution, from several ponds around the CCB aquatic system. I identified the patterns of genetic variation among Vibrionaceae isolates, looking for signals of adaptation to structured (Water column) and non-structured (Sediments) environments within the ponds, as well; I analyzed whether the recombination patterns were associated with these environments or constrained to the lineage history. Since several members of Vibrionaceae possess pathogenic relatives, I also evaluate the hypothesis that the members of Vibrionaceae isolated from Cuatro Cienegas (CCB) had no pathogenic genomic elements, under the assumption that bacteria from CCB rarely get into contact with other bacteria, like oceanic Vibrionaceae.",TRUE
